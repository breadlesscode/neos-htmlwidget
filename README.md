# HTML Widget for Neos CMS

This package allows Administrators to create resuable html widgets, which then can be included by all editors on the website.

Administrators and everyone with the privilegde `CodeQ.HtmlWidget:CreateWidgetDefinition` and `CodeQ.HtmlWidget:EditWidgetDefinition` can create HTML Widget Definitions including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We recommend to create a separate, hidden Widget Definiton page for that.

All editors can add those HTML Widgets as content, similar to normal node types, without being able to change the content.

## Features

*   Automatically blocks JavaScript code in the backend
*   Restricts editing of HTML widget definitions, while allowing editors to use those widgets
